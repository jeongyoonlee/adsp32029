# Causal Models in Data Science - ADSP 32029 (University of Chicago)

This repository contains the official Jupyter Book for **ADSP 32029: Causal Models in Data Science**, a course offered by the University of Chicago. This book serves as the primary resource for lectures, tutorials, and assignments, guiding students through the principles and applications of modern causal inference.

The course curriculum and this Jupyter Book are structured around the **[CausalML Book](https://causalml-book.org/)** by Victor Chernozhukov, Christian Hansen, Nathan Kallus, Martin Spindler, and Vasilis Syrgkanis.
